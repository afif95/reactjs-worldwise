Features
1. Routing
The application utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between different views. Users can easily switch between their list of visited places and an interactive map to visualize their journeys.

2. Memoization
To enhance performance, memoization techniques such as memo, useMemo, and useCallback have been implemented. This ensures that components are only re-rendered when necessary, optimizing the overall user experience.

3. Efficient State Management
The Context API is leveraged for efficient state management, providing a centralized location for managing the application's state. This promotes a clean and maintainable codebase.

4. Interactive Map
Integrated the Leaflet library to create an interactive map that allows users to view and explore their visited places visually. The map provides a dynamic and engaging way to interact with the data.

5. Stylish UI with CSS Modules
CSS Modules are employed for effective styling, ensuring that styles are scoped locally to each component. This makes the codebase more modular and avoids potential styling conflicts.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
